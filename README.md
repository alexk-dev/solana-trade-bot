## Overview

Solana Wallet Bot is your all-in-one Telegram trading companion for the Solana ecosystem. Similar to popular bots like BONKBot, TrojanOnSolana, and BananaGun, but built with superior architecture and security in mind. This feature-rich bot enables users to create and manage Solana wallets, check balances, perform token swaps via Jupiter's powerful DEX aggregator, and execute trades‚Äîall directly from Telegram chats. Whether you're a casual trader or a DeFi power user, this bot provides a comprehensive solution for managing your Solana assets without ever leaving Telegram.

## Project Status

üöÄ **Beta** - Core functionality is complete and working, but some features may be refined based on user feedback.

## Key Features

- **Wallet Management**: Create and manage Solana wallets
- **Balance Checking**: View SOL and SPL token balances with USD equivalents
- **Token Transfers**: Send SOL and SPL tokens to any Solana address
- **Token Swaps**: Swap between tokens using Jupiter DEX aggregator
- **Price Checking**: Get real-time token prices
- **Limit Orders**: Create buy/sell limit orders that execute automatically when price conditions are met
- **Token Watchlist**: Track prices of your favorite tokens
- **Trade Management**: Buy and sell tokens with a simple interface

## Commands

- `/start` - Start working with the bot
- `/create_wallet` - Create a new Solana wallet
- `/menu` - Main menu (UI)
- `/help` - Show help message with command list

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture principles with the VIPER pattern:

- **V**iew: Telegram message interfaces
- **I**nteractor: Business logic implementation
- **P**resenter: Transforms data between View and Interactor
- **E**ntity: Domain models
- **R**outer: Handles command routing and workflow

### Component Interaction

```
User (Telegram) ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Presenter ‚Üí Interactor ‚Üí Services (Solana/Jupiter)
                     ‚Üë         ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
                    View ‚Üê Presenter                  Database
```

The bot uses a dependency injection container to manage service instances and their dependencies, making the code modular and testable.

## Security Considerations

- **Private Keys**: Private keys are stored plain (non encrypted) in the database
- **No External API Keys**: The bot doesn't require users to provide external API keys
- **Confirmations**: All financial transactions require explicit user confirmation
- **Sandboxed Operations**: Each user's operations are isolated
- **Transparent Transactions**: Transaction signatures are provided for all blockchain operations

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **Telegram API**: Teloxide
- **Blockchain**: Solana (solana-sdk, solana-client)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLx
- **DEX Integration**: Jupiter Swap API
- **Background Services**: Tokio for asynchronous processing

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.80+
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/dbname
SOLANA_RPC_URL=your_solana_rpc_url
```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexk-dev/solana-trade-bot.git
cd solana-trade-bot
```

2. Set up the database:
```bash
sqlx database create
sqlx migrate run
```

3. Build and run:
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/solana-trade-bot
```

## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -t solana-trade-bot .
docker run -d --env-file .env --name solana-trade-bot solana-trade-bot
```

## Development Setup

For developers who want to contribute:

1. Set up a development environment:
```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli
cargo install cargo-watch
```

2. Create a test database:
```bash
sqlx database create --database-url postgres://username:password@localhost/solana_bot_test
sqlx migrate run --database-url postgres://username:password@localhost/solana_bot_test
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

4. Run with hot reloading during development:
```bash
cargo watch -x run
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **RPC Rate Limits**: If you encounter errors related to Solana RPC calls, you might be hitting rate limits. Consider using a paid RPC provider.
- **Database Connection**: Ensure your PostgreSQL service is running and the DATABASE_URL is correctly formatted.
- **Token Not Found**: When using custom tokens, make sure you're using the mint address and not the token account address.
- **Insufficient Funds**: For trades and swaps, ensure you have enough SOL to cover both the transaction and network fees.

### Logs

Check the application logs for detailed error messages:
```bash
RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/solana-trade-bot
```

For more verbose logging:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/solana-trade-bot
```
